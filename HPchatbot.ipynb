', 'HPE OneView provides a fast and modern user interface for users, and an open development platform using the Representational State Transfer application-programming interface (REST API). The REST API is designed for those who wish to access full power of the management architecture. A consistent API, a common data model, and a state-change message bus replace the hodgepodge approach found in traditional systems. REST APIs provide a simpler, stateless, and scalable approach, so users can easily integrate, automate, and customize on their own. Developers in the ecosystem are also interested in REST APIs because they are powerful and pervasive in today™s web-based environments. ', 'Ansible, PowerShell, Chef, Puppet, Terraform etc., are all integrations where customers can use to embed within their existing workflows, and reduce not only time to delivery, but also help avoid ﬁvendor lock-in.ﬂ For more info, refer to hpe.com/us/en/solutions/developers/ composable.html. ', 'he HPE OneView architecture has been designed to provide a resource-oriented solution that focuses on the entire hardware lifecycleŠfrom initial configuration to ongoing monitoring and maintenance of both logical resources (like server profiles, networks, and connections) and physical resources (like servers, interconnects, and enclosures). This advanced architecture connects the resources with a common representation of the servers, networks, and storage for the converged infrastructure.

Products like the Service Pack for ProLiant (SPP), System Update Manager (SUM), System Update Tool (SUT), and Agentless Management Service (AMS) are used by HPE OneView. While HPE OneView orchestrates the sequencing and installation of firmware and drivers, it relies on these HPE tools, which operate in the background determining which components to install, understanding their dependencies, installation order and providing status. Updating firmware and drivers manually is time-consuming task but HPE OneView removes the complexity required for updating servers. ', 'The update process HPE OneView utilizes is different between generations of servers (Gen8/9/10) as the update capabilities of the hardware are different. With ProLiant Gen10 and iLO 5, HPE introduced online firmware updates, which allows for firmware and drivers to be pushed to the iLO NAND for installation in real time improving the total server firmware update time required. Keep in mind that some firmware and/or drivers still require a server reboot to activate (i.e. BIOS firmware, or NIC driver), so it™s important to understand the implications of updating a server in production. Using HPE OneView with ProLiant servers, you can schedule updates to occur immediately, at a scheduled time or during next maintenance window. Updating firmware and drivers on ProLiant Gen8/9 and iLO 4 utilizes SUT to push and install updates via a different process, which can take longer.
